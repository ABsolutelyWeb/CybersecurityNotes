============= Hash Functions

In order to securely exchange keys with someone, we need to authenticate them. We must authenticate
before exchanging. We cannot take a public key and simply assume it's the real key.

	- Other cryptographic technologies: Hash functions & digital signatures. These help provide
	  authentication or legitimacy of senders and receivers.
	  
		- A hash function takes input as data of any size (email, file, word, etc.) and it converts
		  it via hash function into a fixed size string of characters. Output is called a hash or 
		  message digest. An important feature of hash functions is that you can never convert back
		  from digest to input (one-way hash function).
