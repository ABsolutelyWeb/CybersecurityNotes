Two Main Components of Encryption

	1. Algorithm (public)
		- publically known
		- comparable to a padlock
		
	2. Key (secret)
		- secretive like a password
		- comparable to a key for a padlock
	
	Algorithm + Key 
	
		- Determines how the plain text will jumble up. plaintext --> cipthertext		
		- If algorithm and key are weak, then the encryption will be weak.
		
	EXAMPLE: 
	
		Say we want to send someone (P1) a file, but don't want anyone else to be able to read it.
		We need something that can encrypt that file. We could use something like winzip and then
		encrypt and password protect it. It will allow us to pick AES.
		
		What is AES?
		
			- AES is a "Symmetric Algorithm" meaning it uses 1 key (password).
			
			- Once you enter in your password, it becomes the key.
			
			256-bit AES vs 128-bit AES
			
				- Is the strength of the algorithm. 256 or 128 represent the bit length / key space
				
				- The higher the bit length, the stronger (generally) the algorithm because it 
				  increases the total possible keys that can exist However, the higher the bit length, 
				  the slower it will be to encrypt / decrypt.
				
				- Imagine a door with many locks. You will be well secured, but it will take longer
				  to open and close it.

What happens if you don't have the key?

	- You have to engage in a brute force attack to guess the key which can take a massive amount of
	  time. 
	- There is also something called a dictionary attack which tries every word in the dictionary
	  against the key. This is typically faster, but if the key is not in the dictionary, it will fail.
	- Hybrid: You can take the psychology of human behavior and combine it with a dictionary and bruce
	          force attack. For example, "dragon" is one of top 10 base phrases used in passwords and
			  we know that numbers are added to the ends of passwords. So we can use "dragon" from the 
			  dictionary and every number combination at the end of "dragon" to see if the key can be
			  cracked.
			  
			  
Examples of Symmetric Encryption Algorithms

	- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
	- Triple-DES (3DES)
	- Blowfish
	- RC4
	- RC5
	- RC6
	- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
	
	Symmetric algorithms are used in most encryption systems that we use everyday such as HTTPS and 
	TOR. Wherever possible, use AES 256.
		- AES is fast and currently unbreakable.
