What does HTTPS mean?

	- It means that all the content of the web page is unreadable to anyone who can see data pass them on 
	  the network (such as govt or ISP). They can only see the destination domain. So if you go to google.com,
	  anyone between you and google.com can only know that you went to google rather than which specific 
	  search.
