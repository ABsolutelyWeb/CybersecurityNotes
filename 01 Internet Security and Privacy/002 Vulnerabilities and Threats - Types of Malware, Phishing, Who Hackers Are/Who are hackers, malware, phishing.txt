========= Know Your Enemy - Understanding the Current Threat and Vulnerability Landscape =========

Why do hackers target people? What is the point?

		- There isn't always a human being that is attacking. It is often times an automated program
		  that is let loose to cause damage and hunt vulnerable software.
		  
		- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): Where some individual or organization is specifically
		  targeting someone or group.
		  
		- Check out the threat intelligence monitor by Norse to see how many attacks are roughly 
		  ongoing in a given time. Norse has purposefully set up "honeypot" servers just to see how
		  many bots and cybercriminals are engaging in attacks.  http://map.norsecorp.com/
		  
		- Access accounts, steal identity, steal money via ransomware or financial credentials, etc.
		
		- Hackers can use our PCs as web servers to host illegal sites. They can also access email
		  accounts to spam our contacts with phishing emails or even use it to access other accounts.
		  
		  
The Vulnerability Landscape

		- Complexity is the enemy of security. The more we are able to do, the more vulnerabilities we
		  can potentially have. The more vulnerabilities we have, the harder the job will be to secure
		  our assets.
		  
		- Security Bug or Vulnerability: An error written into software that creates a potential for a
		  threat agent such as a hacker to exploit it. Such as the heartbleed bug in openSSL which enabled
		  the decryption of internet traffic sent to vulnerable sites to capture account information.
		  
		  
Two Main Types of Bugs

		1. Known
			- Have patches. If you patch your system, you are safe from the known bug.
		
		2. Unknown
			- Also known as "0 Days" which are much harder to protect against since no patch is readily 
			  available.
		

Hackers, Crackers, Cyber Criminals

		1. White Hat Hackers: ethical hackers / penetration testers.
		2. Black Hat Hackers:
				- Criminals attempting to make money at others' expense.
				- Hacking groups, large to small. Loosely connected. Dark web.
				- Lone wolves.
				- Massive majority of them are script kiddies.

								
Malware, Viruses, Rootkits, RATS

		*** Malware *** - An umbrella term for all software written for malicious intent.
			
			- Macro Viruses - Virus written in a macro language like VBS that is platform independent.
			                - Can be embedded in documents. Can run when document is opened.
			
			- Stealth Viruses - Virus that hides modifications that are made. Can trick anti-virus
			                    programs by intercepting their request to the OS by providing fake info.
								
			- Polymorphic Viruses - Produces varied operational copies of itself. May have no parts that
			                        remain identical which makes it difficult to detect.
									
		    - Self-garbling Viruses - Attempt to hide from anti-virus programs by modifying its code so that
			                          it doesn't match pre-defined anti-virus signatures.
									  
			- Bots and Zombies - Collection of hacked devices as part of a bot-net under a hacker.
			
			- Worms - Viruses that spread from one machine to another.
			
			- OS Rootkits - Worst software-based malware possible. Usually embedded within OS kernel and can 
			                effectively hide its existence from OS.
							
			- Firmware Rootkits - Absolute worst. Within a HDD's firmware chip, it is possible to get malware
			                      that cannot be removed even if you format the drive or reinstall OS. You have
								  to find some way to fix it or throw it out.
								- NSA level malware.
								
			- Keyloggers - Log every key you press. Useful for capturing account credentials and other information.	

			- Trojan Horse - Programs that appear to be one thing, but turn out to be malware. It can act as that 
			                 software, but is also running a sinister program within.
							 
			- Remote Access Tools (RATs) - Used to gain control of a computer and access assets remotely. Much like
			                               Teamviewer.
										   
			- Ransomware - Installed on your PC and cannot be easily removed unless you pay the hackers money. Example,
			               hackers can install a program that encrypts all files on your PC. The only way to get the
						   file back is to send the hackers money or Bitcoins. If you do not send them money within
						   the allotted time or try to remove the ransomware, your files are lost.
						   
			- Malvertisement - Fake ads infected with malware that run on sites.
			
			- Drive-by Attack - Visiting a compromised site that contains code to exploit your machine.
			
			- Spyware - Gather information and send info to attacker. Not intended to cause actual damage, but to 
			            compromise privacy and anonymity (spy on victim).
						
			- Adware - Undesirable software that forces ads on you such as displaying ads in browser (browser hijacking).
			
			- Scareware - Social engineering attack meant to scare someone of a threat that isn't real such as
			              fake security software claiming that you've been hacked and need to download a specific
						  software to fix your issues. Scam.
						  
			- Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) - Things that we might not have wanted. Like software that comes
													 with other software that you want.
													 

Phishing, Vishing, SMShing

			Phishing: A type of attack that typically attempts to trick the victim into clicking on a link or executing
			          malware in some way. Can be an attempt to compromise a device to steal assets. It's one of the most 
					  successful and common types of attacks since it's cheap to set up and run and people fall for it.
					  
					  It is a social engineering attack or attack on human weaknesses.
					  
			Spear Phishing: Specific, targetted phishing attempt.
			
			Phishing Techniques (Do NOT click any of the below links just in case):
			
				- Link Manipulation: Make the link appear friendly. 
					- Subdomains & Misspelts e.g. http://www.google.com.blah.net
												  http://blah.net/sa/google.com/support
												  http://www.rnicrosoft.com
					- IDN Homograph Attack
						http://www.g00gle.com
						http://www.goog1e.com
						
					- Hidden URLs: Using HTML a tags to hide url.
						"Click Here" links
					
			Cross-site scripting (XSS): Inserting HTML code into a URL to change the way the website works. Can serve fake
										login page to steal account information.
										
			Vishing: Phone / voice phishing.
			
			SMShing: SMS phishing. Sending text pretending to be someone else in an attempt to compromise you.
			
			
Spamming / Doxing

		Spam: Unsolicited messages typically via email to advertise a products.
		
		Doxing: Abbreviation of document. It is used to search for and identify people and release their information to
				the public. It is to release personal, private information often to cause embarrassment, extort, harass.
				
				
Social Engineering Attacks: Scams, Cons, Tricks, Fraud

		Social Engineering: Attacks that center around human weaknesses / error.
		
		Consumer, Lottery, Inheritance, Financial Aid, Scholarship, Nigerian Princess Scams
		
		Advance Fee Fraud: Paying to recover alleged large sums of money.
		
		ConsumerFraudReporting.org is a site to keep up to date on the latest scamming techniques.
		
		
Darknet / Dark Web

		- General term for an overlay network that can only be accessed using specific software, authorization, ports.
		- Not visible to those who don't have the tools for access.
		- Hacker haven for exploits, kits, and other malware.
		
		
Governments, Spies, Secrets

		- Active mass surveillance is happening across many countries.
		- An agreement between 5 countries dictates that they will cooperatively collect, analyze, share. UK-USA agreement
		  consists of:
		  
		  FIVE EYES using the Internet for mass surveillance. Spying on each other's citizens to avoid breaking domestic laws.
				1. Australia
				2. Canada
				3. New Zealand
				4. United Kingdown
				5. USA
				
		  NINE EYES
				6. Denmark
				7. France
				8. Netherlands
				9. Norway
				
		  FOURTEEN EYES
				10. Belgium
				11. Germany
				12. Italy
				13. Spain
				14. Sweden
				

Trust and Backdoors

		How much can we trust the operating systems and applications that we use everyday?
		
		Closed Source Software - Black box program that can potentially be reverse-engineered and has the possibility
								 of containing a malicious backdoor.
								 
		Open Source Software - Less chance of backdoor since 100% of the code is available.
